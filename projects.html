            This project is all about interactive graphs using javascript. <br/>
            It allows to change the perspective of graphs and check how a given currency is doing for a defined
            timeframe. The data shown on the graphs is predefined, it does not come from a database. <br/>
            My goal is to make an application in Rails where the data will be updated automatically showing actual
            figures. This is probably what I will be trying to do as my second project.
